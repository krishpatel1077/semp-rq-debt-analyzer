## Issues Found

| Location | Debt Type / Problem | Recommended Fix | Reference | Severity |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|----------|
| Main Content: "2.4 Needs Description  This section lists several categories of requirements, in..." | Traceability Gap: The requirements listed in Section 2.4 are not clearly traced back to higher-level needs, system objectives, or stakeholder requirements. This makes it difficult to understand the rationale and importance of each requirement, increasing the risk of inconsistencies or missing requirements. | Implement a requirements traceability matrix (RTM) that links each requirement to its source (e.g., stakeholder needs, system goals, external standards) and documents the rationale. This will help ensure requirements are aligned with the overall system objectives and provide a mechanism for managing changes. | Requirements Debt Detection Guide (score: 0.59); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.49); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.46) | High |
| Main Content: "2.4.1 Information Security (ND-01) The system shall provide secure access to patient data." | Inconsistency: The requirements are stated in a mix of functional, performance, and non-functional terms, with no consistent format or template used. This makes it difficult to assess the testability and achievability of the requirements. | Adopt a standard requirements template that includes fields for requirement type (functional, performance, etc.), measurable acceptance criteria, and verification method. This will help ensure all requirements are well-defined and can be effectively validated. | Requirements Debt Detection Guide (score: 0.59); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.49); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.46) | Medium |
| Main Content: "3.0 Concept of Operations This section provides a high-level overview of the sys..." | Ambiguity: The SEMP does not discuss how the requirements will be verified and validated to ensure they are testable and achievable. Without a clear V&V plan, there is a risk of requirements not being properly implemented or compliance issues being discovered late in the project. | Develop a comprehensive requirements verification and validation plan that outlines the methods (e.g., testing, inspection, analysis) that will be used to confirm each requirement is met. This plan should be integrated with the overall systems engineering processes and lifecycle. | Requirements Debt Detection Guide (score: 0.59); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.49); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.46) | High |
| Main Content: "The SEMP does not contain any information about how requirements will be managed..." | Ambiguity: The SEMP does not mention any specific requirements management processes, tools, or methodologies that will be used to track, version, and maintain requirements throughout the project lifecycle. This increases the risk of requirements debt accumulation, as changes and dependencies may not be properly managed. | Incorporate a requirements management plan into the SEMP that outlines the processes, tools, and responsibilities for managing requirements. This should include mechanisms for requirement change control, traceability, and impact analysis. Consider using a requirements management tool to facilitate these activities. | Requirements Debt Detection Guide (score: 0.59); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.49); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.46) | High |
