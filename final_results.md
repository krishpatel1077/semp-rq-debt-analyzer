## Issues Found

| Location | Debt Type / Problem | Recommended Fix | Reference | Severity |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|----------|
| Main Content: "2.4.1 Information Security (ND-01) The system shall provide information security." | Ambiguity: The requirement for information security is stated in broad, non-specific terms, such as 'the system shall provide information security.' There are no details on the specific security requirements, controls, or verification methods. | Decompose the information security requirement into more granular, measurable sub-requirements that address specific security objectives, such as data encryption, access control, audit logging, etc. Specify the verification criteria for each security requirement. | Requirements Debt Detection Guide (score: 0.59); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.49); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.46) | Medium |
| Main Content: "2.4.2 Regulations Compliance (ND-02) The system shall comply with all relevant regulations." | Traceability Gap: The requirement for regulations compliance does not specify which regulations or standards the system must comply with. There is no traceability to the source of these regulatory requirements. | Identify the specific regulations, standards, or guidelines that the system must comply with, and trace each compliance requirement back to its source (e.g., laws, industry standards, organizational policies). Establish clear links between the system requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements. | Requirements Debt Detection Guide (score: 0.59); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.49); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.46) | High |
| Main Content: "2.4.3 Automation (ND-03) The system shall provide automation." | Vague Terminology: The requirement for automation is stated in very general terms, using the phrase 'the system shall provide automation.' This requirement lacks specificity and does not clearly define the expected level or scope of automation. | Rephrase the automation requirement to be more specific, such as 'the system shall automatically perform X, Y, and Z tasks without human intervention' or 'the system shall provide automated data processing and analysis capabilities to reduce manual effort by 50%.' Include measurable criteria for the desired level of automation. | Requirements Debt Detection Guide (score: 0.59); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.49); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.46) | Medium |
| Main Content: "2.4.4 Communication (ND-04) The system shall provide communication capabilities." | Incompleteness: The requirement for communication is stated in a very broad manner, without specifying the communication interfaces, protocols, or capabilities required. There is no mention of how the system will communicate with other systems or users. | Decompose the communication requirement into more detailed sub-requirements that address specific communication needs, such as user-to-system interfaces, system-to-system interfaces, data exchange formats, real-time communication capabilities, etc. Ensure that each communication requirement is clearly defined and traceable to higher-level needs or system objectives. | Requirements Debt Detection Guide (score: 0.59); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.49); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.46) | High |
| Main Content: "2.4.5 Reliability (ND-05) The system shall be reliable." | Unclear Acceptance Criteria: The requirement for reliability is stated in qualitative terms, using the phrase 'the system shall be reliable.' There are no quantitative metrics or acceptance criteria defined to measure the desired level of reliability. | Rephrase the reliability requirement to include specific, measurable criteria, such as 'the system shall have a mean time between failures (MTBF) of at least 10,000 hours' or 'the system shall maintain 99.9% uptime during normal operating conditions.' Define the verification methods (e.g., testing, analysis) that will be used to validate the reliability requirement. | Requirements Debt Detection Guide (score: 0.59); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.49); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.46) | Medium |
| Main Content: "2.4.6 Portability (ND-06) The system shall be portable." | Inconsistency: The requirement for portability is stated in isolation, without any context or linkage to other system requirements or design constraints. It is unclear how the portability requirement relates to the overall system architecture or user needs. | Analyze the portability requirement in the context of the system's intended use, operating environment, and other functional and non-functional requirements. Ensure that the portability requirement is consistent with and traceable to higher-level needs, such as supporting multiple hardware platforms, enabling cross-platform data exchange, or facilitating system migration. Specify the criteria for evaluating portability, such as the target operating systems, hardware platforms, or data formats. | Requirements Debt Detection Guide (score: 0.59); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.49); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.46) | Medium |
