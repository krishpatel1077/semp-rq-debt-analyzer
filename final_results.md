## Issues Found

| Location | Debt Type / Problem | Recommended Fix | Reference | Severity |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|----------|
| Main Content: "2.4.1 Information Security (ND-01) The system shall provide information security." | Ambiguity: The requirement states that the 'system shall provide information security', but does not define what 'information security' entails or provide any measurable criteria. | Rewrite the requirement to specify the key information security objectives, such as data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Provide clear, testable acceptance criteria for each security requirement. | Requirements Debt Detection Guide (score: 0.59); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.49); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.46) | Medium |
| Main Content: "2.4.2 Regulations Compliance (ND-02) The system shall comply with all relevant regulations." | Incompleteness: The requirement states that the 'system shall comply with all relevant regulations', but does not list the specific regulations or standards that must be met. There is no traceability to the source of these regulatory requirements. | Identify and list all the relevant regulations, standards, and compliance requirements that the system must meet. Trace each requirement back to the specific regulation or stakeholder need driving the compliance requirement. | Requirements Debt Detection Guide (score: 0.59); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.49); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.46) | High |
| Main Content: "2.4.3 Automation (ND-03) The system shall provide a high degree of automation." | Ambiguity: The requirement states that the 'system shall provide a high degree of automation', but does not define what 'high degree' means or provide any quantifiable metrics for the level of automation required. | Rewrite the requirement to specify the key automation objectives, such as the percentage of tasks to be automated, the response time for automated actions, or the reduction in manual intervention required. Provide clear, measurable acceptance criteria for the automation capabilities. | Requirements Debt Detection Guide (score: 0.59); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.49); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.46) | Medium |
| Main Content: "2.4.4 Communication (ND-04) The system shall provide effective communication." | Ambiguity: The requirement states that the 'system shall provide effective communication', but does not define what 'effective communication' means or how it will be measured. | Rewrite the requirement to specify the key communication objectives, such as the types of information to be communicated, the timeliness of communication, the target audience, and the communication channels to be used. Provide clear, measurable acceptance criteria for the communication capabilities. | Requirements Debt Detection Guide (score: 0.59); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.49); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.46) | Medium |
| Main Content: "2.4.5 Reliability (ND-05) The system shall be reliable." | Ambiguity: The requirement states that the 'system shall be reliable', but does not define what 'reliable' means or provide any quantifiable metrics for system reliability. | Rewrite the requirement to specify the key reliability objectives, such as the target uptime percentage, the maximum allowable downtime, the mean time between failures, or the mean time to repair. Provide clear, measurable acceptance criteria for the reliability requirements. | Requirements Debt Detection Guide (score: 0.59); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.49); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.46) | Medium |
| Main Content: "2.4.6 Portability (ND-06) The system shall be portable." | Ambiguity: The requirement states that the 'system shall be portable', but does not define what 'portable' means or provide any criteria for the level of portability required. | Rewrite the requirement to specify the key portability objectives, such as the target operating systems, hardware platforms, or deployment environments. Provide clear, measurable acceptance criteria for the portability requirements. | Requirements Debt Detection Guide (score: 0.59); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.49); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.46) | Medium |
| Main Content: "3.0 Concept of Operations #Limit content length" | Incompleteness: The Concept of Operations section is missing, with the content limited to '#Limit content length'. This prevents a full understanding of how the system will be used and operated, and how the requirements are derived from the operational needs. | Expand the Concept of Operations section to provide a detailed description of the system's intended use, the operational environment, the key stakeholders and their roles, and the operational scenarios and use cases. Ensure that the requirements can be clearly traced back to the operational needs and constraints defined in this section. | Requirements Debt Detection Guide (score: 0.59); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.49); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.46) | High |
