## Issues Found

| Location | Debt Type / Problem | Recommended Fix | Reference | Severity |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|----------|
| Main Content: "The Needs Description section lists several high-level requirements categories, ..." | Ambiguity: This requirement is overly specific and reads more like a design decision than a true functional requirement. It does not clearly state the underlying need or purpose that the system must fulfill. | Rewrite the requirement to focus on the actual user or stakeholder need, rather than implementation details. For example: 'The system shall provide sufficient storage capacity to maintain all patient medical records for the target population, with each record containing a minimum of 1MB of data.' | Requirements Debt Detection Guide (score: 0.59); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.49); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.46) | Medium |
| Main Content: "The Needs Description section lists several high-level requirements categories, ..." | Incompleteness: This requirement is also overly specific and reads more like a design decision than a true functional requirement. It does not clearly state the underlying need or purpose that the system must fulfill in terms of memory capacity. | Rewrite the requirement to focus on the actual user or stakeholder need, rather than implementation details. For example: 'The system shall provide sufficient memory capacity to support the expected data processing and storage requirements for the target user population, with the ability to expand as needed.' | Requirements Debt Detection Guide (score: 0.59); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.49); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.46) | Medium |
| Main Content: "The Needs Description section lists several high-level requirements categories, ..." | Traceability Gap: The SEMP does not outline a clear process for maintaining traceability between requirements, design, and verification. Without a robust traceability mechanism, it will be difficult to track changes, verify implementation, and assess the impact of modifications. | Incorporate a section in the SEMP that describes the requirement traceability process, including the use of tools (e.g., requirements management software, traceability matrices) and methodologies for linking requirements to higher-level needs, design elements, and verification activities. | Requirements Debt Detection Guide (score: 0.59); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.49); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.46) | High |
| Main Content: "The Needs Description section lists several high-level requirements categories, ..." | Unclear Acceptance Criteria: The SEMP does not specify how the requirements will be verified and validated to ensure they are measurable and achievable. Without a well-defined V&V process, it will be difficult to assess compliance later in the project, leading to costly rework. | Add a section to the SEMP that outlines the verification and validation plan for the requirements. This should include the specific methods (e.g., testing, inspection, analysis) that will be used to confirm that each requirement is met, as well as the criteria for determining successful verification. | Requirements Debt Detection Guide (score: 0.59); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.49); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.46) | High |
| Main Content: "The SEMP does not discuss how requirements debt will be identified, managed, or ..." | Missing Constraints: The SEMP does not outline a proactive approach to monitoring requirements stability and completeness. Without a defined process for identifying, tracking, and addressing requirements debt, the risk of debt accumulation and its associated impacts (e.g., rework, cost overruns) increases. | Incorporate a section in the SEMP that describes the requirements debt management process. This should include methods for regularly reviewing requirements, identifying potential debt, and implementing mitigation strategies (e.g., requirement refinement, traceability improvements, verification enhancements) to address debt before it becomes a significant issue. | Requirements Debt Detection Guide (score: 0.59); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.49); NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (score: 0.46) | High |
